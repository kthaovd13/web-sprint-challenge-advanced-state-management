1. What problem does the context API help solve? It helps to simplify state management.
1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
Actions help send data to the store.  Reducers tells the app what state has changed.  The store holds all the state for the app.
1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other? Application state is the state of your whole app and component state is localized.
1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?  Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object.
1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!  Suprisingly Redux because I have spent to much time trying to learn it that I've gotten a better understanding of how it works.
